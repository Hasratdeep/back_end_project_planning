# Task Management API

# PROJECT CONCEPT
# Purpose and theme of project:
- I choose Task Management API that will help the users to keep 
track of their tasks. Also, users can add new tasks, see their current tasks
 and update them or delete their tasks that they don’t need. 
 This API acts like back-end application that helps to organize everything.
- So, Basically I choose this API because it is simple to built and
 is a good way in creating API and using database.

# SCOPE AND FUNCTIONALITY
API's planned functionality, endpoints and data needs.
- This API has two major parts USERS and TASKS.
- Users Create accounts and manage accounts. 
On the other hand, tasks have a title, description, status.

# USERS

- Endpoints allow creating, reading, updating 
and deleting both users and tasks.

# COURSE ALIGNMENT

that we have studied earlier in our course, which includes:
